At the heart of Talos is [`kubeadm`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/kubeadm), allowing it to harness the power of the official upstream bootstrap tool.
By integrating with `kubeadm` natively, Talos stands to gain a strong community of users and developers already familiar with `kubeadm`.
